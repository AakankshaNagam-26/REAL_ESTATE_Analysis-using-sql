# REAL_ESTATE_Analysis-Using-sql
MYSQL REALESTATE-DATABASE PROJECT

📊Real Estate Database project with 25–30 tables, each with 5+ attributes and 20+ records. Includes  sample data and queries to manage properties, clients, agents, sales, rentals, and payments.
                 
📌 Features
•	25–30 normalized tables with at least 5 attributes each.
•	Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram for clear schema visualization.
•	Implementation of Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and Relationships.
•	Preloaded sample data for testing.
•	Example SQL queries for real estate analytics:
o	Top-selling agents
o	High-value properties
o	Rental revenue reports
o	Active client transactions

🛠️ Tech Stack
•	Database: MySQL (tested on MySQL 8.0+)
•	Scripts: SQL (DDL for schema, DML for data, Joins, Views, Functions)

🧾CONSISTS OF 3 PHASES
	Phase-1: Database Design, Creation & Basic Queries
________________________________________
🔰 Objective
The objective of Phase-1 is to design and implement a unique real-world database system that demonstrates understanding of:
•	Database creation and structure
•	Table design with constraints
•	Data insertion and connectivity
•	Execution of basic SQL operations
•	Documentation and logical database analysis

  Phase-2: Leverage SQL joins, Subqueries and Functions to combine data from your 25       interconnected tables.
________________________________________
🔰 Objective
This stage demonstrates your ability to:
•	Connect multiple tables logically using joins
•	Retrieve nested data with subqueries
•	Utilize built-in SQL functions for transformation and aggregation


  Phase-3: This repository demonstrates SQL query mastery, including DDL, DML, DQL, operators, clauses, aliases, and cascading rules.
It contains a rich variety of queries executed on both existing and newly created database 
________________________________________
🔰 Objective
⚙️ Data Definition Language (DDL)
•	 Create and alter tables with defined data types, constraints, and relationships.
•	 Apply PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and DEFAULT constraints.
•	 Use ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE for referential integrity.
 ✍️ Data Manipulation Language (DML)
•	 INSERT records with realistic values across interconnected tables.
•	 UPDATE existing records using conditions and logical operators.
•	 DELETE records safely while maintaining foreign key dependencies.
🔍  Data Query Language (DQL)
•	 Execute SELECT queries with filters, aggregates, and subqueries.
•	 Use DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY to organize and analyze data.
•	 Implement various JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, SELF, CROSS) for relationship-based   querying.
🧮 Operators Demonstrated
•	 Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
•	 Comparison: =, !=, <, >, <=, >=
•	 Logical: AND, OR, NOT
•	 Special: IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL, EXISTS
🧱 Clauses Implemented
•	 WHERE – filters data precisely
•	 ORDER BY – sorts results ascending/descending
•	 GROUP BY – aggregates similar data
•	 HAVING – filters groups post-aggregation
•	 LIMIT – controls query output size
     ✨ Alias Usage
•	Applied column and table aliases for improved readability and concise query structure.
